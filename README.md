# Slinger
### Version 1.1

#### ...Los Angeles, in the near future
#### Can you stay alive long enough to earn a fortune selling neural implants on the black market?

### Installation Instructions
1) Access your Command Line (Terminal for OSX)* and enter:
    ruby -v
If you are running Ruby 2.3... great! Move on to step 4.

2) Your Ruby version is incompatible with the game, so if you choose to update,
go to brew.sh in your browser to install the Homebrew package manager.
This application will handle the installation/update of Ruby to the newest
version. 

3) Once Homebrew is installed, you can install the latest Ruby version by
typing into your Command Line:
    brew install ruby

You can find more information here, on the [Ruby installation page]
(https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#homebrew):

4) Now that your system is up to date, download and unzip the Slinger
directory.

5) Using the Command Line, navigate to the newly created folder. You will see 3
files with the .rb extension. These are the Ruby files that run the game.
Always keep them together and do not rename them. To launch the game, type into
the Command Line prompt:
    ruby game.rb

Good luck, enjoy the game.
