		------------------------------------

		Los Angeles, not long from now...

		GeneTech Inc. invents the neural implant: an injection of nano-bots
		that supercharges human ability and improves speed, strength, and the
		senses - at an astronomical cost. 

		The gap between between rich and poor expands, as those who can afford
		implants become more than human. Poverty and crime metastisize in urban
		centers, which spiral into anarchy.

		#{BREAK}
		Hoping to even the field, a GeneTech engineer leaks the key technology
		behind neural implantation, creating a booming black market for
		powerful - but dangerous - street implants.

		These implants, patched together in mobile labs, often malfunction
		and kill their users - or worse. The streets of Los Angeles now crawl
		with feral hunters called glitchers, victims of broken implants who
		prey on other users, obsessed with further enhancements.

		As a slinger, you ride LA's subway, buying and selling black market
		implants. You have 30 days to earn, if you can survive. glitchers, other
		slingers, and GeneTech Security are hunting you.

		And don't forget to pay back your loan before GeneTech Bank decides to
		send a few collectors after you. Maybe invest in protection...

		If things get too tough, you can always take one of your implants - if 
		you think it's worth the risk.
